# Functional Requirements

This section lists the functional specifications for the ONETAGUMVISION platform, as derived from consultations with stakeholders and aligned with the project's core objectives:

1. Allow authorized users (Head Engineer) to create, update infrastructure project records, including project name, location, budget, project engineer, and status.

2. Allow authorized users (Project Engineer and Architect) to update and monitor project progress, budget and status.

3. Focuses on integrating Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap to create an interactive map that displays all registered infrastructure projects. This feature enables users to visualize project locations in real-time, with the ability to filter projects based on various criteria such as project type, status (e.g., ongoing, completed, delayed), or location. By supporting real-time updates, this functionality ensures that project information is always current, providing valuable insights for project monitoring and decision-making.

4. Data Visualization & Analytics- Provides visual summaries (charts, graphs, map overlays) of project distribution, budget allocation, and completion rates.

5. Search & Filter Functionality- Enables users to search for projects by name, location, date, status, and apply multiple filters for refined results.

6. Roles-Based Access Control- Ensures access to features and data based on user roles (Head Engineer, Project Engineer), with an intuitive login and permissions system.
